# CompileMRI - mritools

[![Build Status](https://github.com/korbinian90/CompileMRI.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/korbinian90/CompileMRI.jl/actions)

## [Download executables for ROMEO, CLEAR-SWI and MCPC-3D-S (Linux and Windows)](https://github.com/korbinian90/CompileMRI.jl/releases)

*Note for MacOS:* We automatically compile for MacOS too, however, it seems to only run on the same version it was compiled on (`macos-11`). The MacOS executables are not signed and require the user to allow the execution of multiple files.

## Compile ROMEO and CLEAR-SWI

1. Install Julia

   Please install Julia using the binaries from this page https://julialang.org. (Julia 1.9 is recommended, newer versions might error)

2. Install CompileMRI

   Start Julia (Type julia in the command line or start the installed Julia executable)

   Type the following in the Julia REPL:

   ```julia
   julia> ] # Be sure to type the closing bracket via the keyboard
   # Enters the Julia package manager

   # optional: activate a local julia project in the current folder
   (@v1.9) pkg> activate . 

   (compile) pkg> dev https://github.com/korbinian90/CompileMRI.jl
   # All dependencies are installed automatically
   (compile) pkg> build CompileMRI
   ```

3. Create a command line executable

   ```julia
   julia> using CompileMRI
   julia> compile("/tmp/compiled")
   ```

   If the folder to output the binary (here `/tmp/compiled`) already exists, the additional keyword argument `force=true` is required:

   ```julia
   julia> compile("/tmp/compiled"; force=true)
   ```

### Update to newest version

Since I'm using unregistered packages in dev mode, it is tricky to get updates to packages.
Easiest is to remove the folder `user/.julia/dev/CompileMRI` and start over at step 2.

## Known problems

### Workaround for Permission Denied Error

```bash
ERROR: SystemError: opening file "/<path>/RomeoApp/<subfolder>/Project.toml"
```

If the compilation fails because of missing permissions, the `RomeoApp` folder needs write permission. In that case, changing the permission with

```bash
chmod 777 /<path>/RomeoApp/<subfolder>
```

and rerunning the command with

```julia
julia> compile("/tmp/compiled"; force=true)
```

should work.
